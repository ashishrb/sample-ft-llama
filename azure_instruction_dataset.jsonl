We need to raise a support case to know if any termination fees is applicable for the customer. If the amount is less than 50000 then the customer will receive the complete refund. If the unused RI amount is more than 50k we can raise a case with Microsoft to understand the refund amount we will be receiving. Although the chances are unlikely but we can also ask Microsoft to waive off the termination cap. Once we are aware about the refund amount we can ask the Delivery Team to cancel all the workloads. They can raise a technical support case for Microsoft guidance on how to cancel all the workloads and cancel their subscriptions.  Once the subscriptions are cancelled delivery team needs to inform CSP team so that the delivery teams access from CSP Portal can be revoked.

Instance size flexibility applies the reservation discount to other VMs in the same VM size group. Capacity priority designates data center capacity most important for your deployments. By default when the scope of the reservation is shared the instance size flexibility is on. The data Center capacity isnt prioritized for VM deployments. The reserved VMs can be optimised using Reserved instance flexibility.  Here is the example how you can take the benefit: You buy a reserved VM instance with the size Standard_DS4_v2 where the ratio or relative footprint compared to the other sizes in that series is 8.  Scenario 1: Run eight Standard_DS1_v2 sized VMs with a ratio of 1. Your reservation discount applies to all eight of those VMs.  Scenario 2: Run two Standard_DS2_v2 sized VMs with a ratio of 2 each. Also run a Standard_DS3_v2 sized VM with a ratio of 4. The total footprint is 2248. So your reservation discount applies to all three of those VMs.  Scenario 3: Run one Standard_DS5_v2 with a ratio of 16. Your reservation discount applies to half that VMs compute cost.
